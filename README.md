# Covid-19-Computer-Vision-Project
This repository contains the files used in my Covid-19 classification project using convolutional neural networks, as well as using the model to build an application.

## Description
The goal of this project was to build an Image Classification model to identify the X-Rays of patients that contracted the Corona Virus, patients that had Pneumonia and normal, healthy patients. I wanted to understand the fundamentals behind AI and used image recognition as a foundation for the same. 

## What to install
Install tensorflow, and keras for model creation and training, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization. You can run it on google colab or your local IDE, whichever your choice.

## How to run the project
I followed this [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification) for the project to know what dependencies to import and how to load the data for preprocessing and model training and validation.
